# Scenario-Planning-Tool
Scenario Planning Tool (Excel) Created a simple Excel model to compare Best, Realistic, and Worst Case scenarios for sales and gross margin. Used inputs like discount, COGS, and sales units to calculate net sales, margin, and performance vs. target. Helped in checking how profit changes under different situations and supported better planning.
